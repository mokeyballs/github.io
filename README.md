# 🧠 Jake’s Logseq Public Notes 
(EMBRACING THE USE OF AI AS A PROMPT ENGINEER) 

This repository hosts my public Logseq journals and notes, which have been cleaned, curated, and published as a simple GitHub Pages site.

## 📘 Overview
- Built directly from Markdown files (`_posts/` folder).
- Hosted automatically via **GitHub Pages**.
- Powered by Jekyll’s `minima` theme (no build chain, no nonsense).
- Everything here is public, internal, or sensitive notes stay in my private Logseq graph reports

## 🧩 Structure
Work in progress! (WIP)

NOTE: No personally identifiable information (PII), internal IP addresses, Excel-spreadsheets, or passwords are ever stored or committed to GitHub. All public-facing notes are sanitized, redacted, and minimized to include only essential technical or contextual details for brevity and clarity.

**MORE TO COME STAY TUNNED**
