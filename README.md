# ðŸ§  Jakeâ€™s Logseq Public Notes

This repo hosts my public Logseq journals and notes â€” cleaned, curated, and published as a simple GitHub Pages site.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
- Built directly from Markdown files (`_posts/` folder).
- Hosted automatically via **GitHub Pages**.
- Powered by Jekyllâ€™s `minima` theme (no build chain, no nonsense).
- Everything here is public â€” internal or sensitive notes stay in my private Logseq graph reports

## ðŸ§© Structure
Work in progress! (WIP)

NOTE: No personally identifiable information (PII), internal IP addresses, or passwords are ever stored or committed to GitHub. All public-facing notes are sanitized, redacted, and minimized to include only essential technical or contextual details for brevity and clarity.
