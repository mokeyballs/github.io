Ritle: "Homelab Journal â€“ Building a Public Logseq Blog"
tags: [homelab, logseq, github, journaling]


## ðŸ§© Summary
Today, I decided to take my Logseq journals one step further, turning them into a public, web-readable blog hosted entirely on GitHub Pages ...the goal: simplicity, zero external dependencies, and complete control over what gets published.

## ðŸ”§ Work Completed
- Created a new GitHub repo for public notes.
- Configured **GitHub Pages** with the `minima` Jekyll theme for easy hosting.
- Set up folder structure:


- Added a basic **README.md** to document publishing workflow.
- Verified live site deployment under `https://<yourusername>.github.io`.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Write a few initial entries pulled from older Logseq journals.
- Automate sanitization of private/internal content before publishing.
- Add custom favicon and minimal CSS tweaks.
- Possibly integrate **Pagefind** later for client-side search.

## ðŸ’­ Notes
This project keeps the process dead simple â€” pure Markdown and Git. No Node build chain, no Eleventy or Hugo complexity.  
Each Logseq daily page thatâ€™s worth sharing just becomes a post under `_posts/` with front matter and a title.
